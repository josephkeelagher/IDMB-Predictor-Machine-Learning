# Running the models:
In DataPreProcessing.ipynb is where you'll find the figure and table production of the data analysation stage. It also occurs in each individual model's cells at the start.

For all .ipyn files, they are named after the classifier they explore, they are cohesive and don't interact with each other so can be individually analysed.
Simply click run on each cell starting from the top and going all the way down to see the construction process of each model. 
Gradient Boosting and Stacking take a significant amount of time to run (up to 10 minutes from personal experiences).
